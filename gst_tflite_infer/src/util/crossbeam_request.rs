//! mpsc_requests rewritten for crossbeam, written by @stjepang (https://github.com/crossbeam-rs/crossbeam/issues/353#issuecomment-484013974)
//!
//! crossbeam_requests is a small library built on top of crossbeam-channel but with
//! the addition of the consumer responding with a message to the producer.
//! Since the producer no longer only produces and the consumer no longer only consumes, the
//! Producer is renamed to [RequestSender] and the Consumer is renamed to [RequestReceiver].
//!
//! This library is based on crossbeam-requests instead of mpsc channels in the standard library
//! because crossbeam has better performance and better compatibility with android.
//!
//! A perfect use-case for this library is single-threaded databases which need
//! to be accessed from multiple threads (such as SQLite)
//!
//! Here's a diagram of the dataflow
//!
//! |--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
//! | Thread    | Request thread |            Respond thread           |  Request thread   |
//! |--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
//! | Struct    | RequestSender ->  RequestReceiver  -> ResponseSender -> ResponseReceiver |
//! | (methods) |   (request)   -> (poll, poll_loop) ->    (respond)   ->    (collect)     |
//! |--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
//!
//! # Examples
//! For more examples, see the examples directory
//!
//! For even more examples see the tests in the tests directory
//!
//! ## Simple echo example
//! ```rust,run
//! use std::thread;
//! use crossbeam_requests::channel;
//!
//! type RequestType = String;
//! type ResponseType = String;
//! let (requester, responder) = channel::<RequestType, ResponseType>();
//! thread::spawn(move || {
//!     responder.poll_loop(|req, res_sender| {
//!         res_sender.respond(req);
//!     });
//! });
//! let msg = String::from("Hello");
//! let receiver = requester.request(msg.clone()).unwrap();
//! let res = receiver.collect().unwrap();
//! assert_eq!(res, msg);
//! ```
